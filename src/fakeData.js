        title: "Spicy Tofu Vegetable Stir-Fry",
        ingredients: [
          "10 ounces (283g) extra-firm tofu",
          "1 Tbsp (15ml) toasted sesame oil",
          "3 cups (~350g) raw vegetables, chopped (broccoli, carrots, and/or cauliflower)",
          "1–2 Tbsp (15–30g) chili garlic sauce (reduce for less heat)",
          "¼ cup (60ml) maple syrup or agave nectar (or substitute coconut sugar)",
          "¼ cup (60ml) tamari or soy sauce (if gluten-free, use tamari)",
          "3 cloves garlic (1½ Tbsp or 9g), minced",
          "1 lime, juiced (2 Tbsp or 30ml)",
          "1 Tbsp (15ml) toasted sesame oil",
          "1 Tbsp (8g) cornstarch or arrowroot starch, for thickening"
        ],
        steps: [
          "Wrap the tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top, such as a cast-iron skillet, to aid in absorbing excess moisture. Let rest for 15 minutes. Prepare the marinade at this time.",
          "Add all of the marinade ingredients (except the cornstarch) to a plastic bag and toss/shake to combine. Once the tofu is pressed, cube it and add it to the marinade. Toss to combine.",
          "Place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight (up to 2 days). The longer it rests, the stronger and more pronounced the flavor will become.",
          "When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp (15ml) sesame oil. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the tofu into the skillet, leaving the majority of the marinade behind.",
          "Cook for 4–5 minutes, stirring frequently and adding 1–2 Tbsp (15–30 ml) marinade to add extra flavor. Flip/toss the tofu around to get all of the sides evenly browned. Reduce the heat if browning too quickly. Remove the pan from the heat and scoop out the tofu. Set aside (see note).",
          "Add the cornstarch to the remaining marinade in the plastic bag. Toss the contents to thicken the sauce.",
          "Place the pan back over medium heat. Add the vegetables and remaining marinade. Sauté the vegetables, stirring frequently, for 1–2 minutes or until just tender. Then add the tofu back in and cook for 1–2 minutes more.",
          "Serve as is or with white rice, brown rice, or Cauliflower Rice. Serve with extra chili garlic sauce for added heat.",
          "Leftovers will keep stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or a skillet over medium heat until hot."

          "Arrange tomato and bell peppers, still whole with stems, on one end of a rimmed baking sheet. On the other end of the baking sheet, arrange the almonds and garlic (still in skin). Lightly drizzle the garlic with the grape seed oil.",
          "Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast the almonds for 6–7 minutes, then remove from pan and set aside. Bake garlic for another 5–8 minutes, then remove and set aside.",
          "Allow tomato and red pepper to roast until the skin is bubbled and mostly blackened, turning/flipping periodically to char all sides.",
